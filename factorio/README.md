To run this factorio server, first run the following commands:
`sudo mkdir /opt/factorio` - This directory will contain both config and saves
`sudo chown 845:845 /opt/factorio`

Then you can just use `docker-compose` with no arguments to start the server. You can use `-d` if you want to detach the container.
